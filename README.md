bput-result-fetcher
===================

This app fetches the results from bput and shows it.

Whenever this app starts it takes a URL as "http://results.bput.ac.in/345_RES/" then
you have to provide the starting Roll No and the number of resulrs. Then it will
fetch the results from BPUT.

Though you can provide as many number of results as you wish but as you have to consider 
your network bandeidth and BPUT server status(All BPUT students must have known how 
fast BPUT server is!).
