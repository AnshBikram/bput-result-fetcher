bput-result-fetcher
===================

This app fetches the results from bput and shows it.

Whenever this app starts it takes a URL e.g "http://results.bput.ac.in/335_RES" then
you have to provide the starting ID (e.g 1101111014) and the number of results. Then it will
fetch the results from BPUT.

Though you can provide as many number of results as you wish but as you have to consider 
your network bandwidth and BPUT server status (All BPUT students known how fast BPUT server is! ;)).
